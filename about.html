            <p>From a young age I was fascinated with the idea of capturing a moment in time. Photography is exactly that. In 2010, I was given the opportunity to live in the United Kingdom and I knew I wanted to capture the adventure in photographs to share with friends and family. My first dSLR was a Canon Rebel. I bought it while still living in Las Vegas and travelled around the local area, learning how to use it. It wasn't long before I realized how much I enjoyed photography, especially landscape photography.</p>

            <p>First and foremost, I am a father and a husband. I have a beautiful wife, whom I met while living in England. We married in December 2013 and have had many adventures since. The biggest adventure so far was becoming parents. I have a beautiful, strong daughter and a rambunctious, clever son. They have added a lot of joy (and sometimes stress) to our lives, but we love watching them grow and develop into amazing human beings.</p>

            <p>On December 9th, 2003, I enlisted in the United States Air Force. It was arguably the best decision I made. I could not imagine where I would have ended up had I not joined. I enlisted as an F-15 Avoinic Components and Test Stations technician, where I tested and repaired faulty avionic components. I was lucky enough to be stationed at Nellis Air Force Base in Las Vegas, NV for my first duty station. After approximately five years, I applied and was accepted to re-train and become an enlisted air crew member as a flight engineer on HH-60G Pave Hawk helicopters. After a short-lived career as an enlisted aviator, in 2012, I was medically disqualified from flight status and placed back in my original career field as an avionics technician. In 2013, I applied for my third job in the Air Force. I became a Special Agent with the Office of Special Investigations (OSI) in June 2014 and have been enjoying that adventure ever since.</p>
