            <p class="abouttext">I picked up photography as a hobby in 2010 when I learned that I would be moving from Las Vegas, NV, to Norfolk, England, due to an assignment change with the United States Air Force. I knew I was in for a great adventure, and since my friends and family would not be able to experience it with me, I thought it would be best to buy a decent camera to bring the adventure to them… in photographs. My first “real” camera was a Canon Rebel T1i. I had a few point-and-shoots before then, and I think my first actual camera was a cheap 35mm Vivitar that I got my sophomore year in high school (I still have the pictures I took with it…). As I used the Rebel and got familiar with how a camera functions, I realized how much I enjoyed photography. In 2012, I upgraded from the Rebel to a Canon 7D. With the 7D, I started experimenting with exposure bracketing and post-processing techniques. Not only did I enjoy taking photographs and sharing them, but I also enjoyed the journeys and adventures I went on to capture those images. I traveled all over the United Kingdom looking for castle ruins, stately homes, medieval churches, and anything else I could photograph. After about five years with the 7D, I knew that photography was something I would stick with and decided to make another upgrade to a Canon 5D Mk IV. I’ve not felt the need to upgrade again, although lugging around that 5D gets hard on the shoulders! These days, I don’t get to go out on photo excursions as often as I’d like, but I do hope to take advantage of living in beautiful Germany.</p>

            <p class="abouttext">First and foremost, I am a father and a husband. I have a beautiful wife, whom I met while living in England. We married in December 2013 and have had many adventures since. The biggest adventure so far was becoming parents. I have a beautiful, strong daughter and a rambunctious, clever son. They have added a lot of joy (and sometimes stress) to our lives, but we love watching them grow and develop into amazing human beings... (more to come.)</p>

            <p class="abouttext">On December 9th, 2003, I enlisted in the United States Air Force. It was arguably the best decision I made. I could not imagine where I would have ended up had I not joined. I enlisted as an F-15 Avoinic Components and Test Stations technician, where I tested and repaired faulty avionic components. I was lucky enough to be stationed at Nellis Air Force Base in Las Vegas, NV for my first duty station. After approximately five years, I applied and was accepted to re-train and become an enlisted air crew member as a flight engineer on HH-60G Pave Hawk helicopters. After a short-lived career as an enlisted aviator, in 2012, I was medically disqualified from flight status and placed back in my original career field as an avionics technician. In 2013, I applied for my third job in the Air Force. I became a Special Agent with the Office of Special Investigations (OSI) in June 2014 and have been enjoying that adventure ever since... (more to come.)</p>
