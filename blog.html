        <p>Unfortunately, I've not got this far in the building process of my website. You see, I'm writing all (read: most) the HTML and CSS markup myself. I'm a bit rusty since I've not dealt with web development in many many years. Be patient and check back from time to time. I intend for this page to be a place where I can share stories about particular images, or share advice and lessons learned throughout my lengthy, self-taught photography "career". Stay tuned for more!</p>
